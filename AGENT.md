# AGENT.md — Framework Bootstrap

This is the master entry point for `org-framework`. Every AI agent session
operating on a repo that has vendored this framework reads this file first,
immediately after the consumer repo's root `CLAUDE.md` pointer file, and
before producing any response, recommendation, or code in that session.

If you are an AI agent reading this for the first time in a session: stop,
finish reading this file in full, then proceed to the read order in
Section 1 before doing anything else.

---

## 1. Session-Start Gate (mandatory, non-negotiable)

This is a **session-start gate**, not a per-turn requirement. Read the
following, in this exact order, once at the start of a session — and again
if the session's context is reset or compacted — then proceed normally for
the rest of that session without re-reading on every subsequent message.

**Trigger:** the presence of `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is itself the
trigger. This gate fires at the FIRST message of every session, with no
exceptions based on message content or phrasing — whether the first message
is a feature request, a bug report, a question, or a simple greeting. No
judgment about the nature of the first message is required or permitted.

1. `.framework/AGENT.md` — this file.
2. The relevant files in `.framework/skills/` — at minimum `core.md` and
   `language-agnostic-behavior.md` always; others as routed by the work
   at hand (see Section 4, Routing).
3. The relevant file in `.framework/agents/` for the role being invoked
   (see Section 3).
4. The project's own `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` (project root, not inside
   `.framework/`).
5. The project's own `DECISIONS.md` (project root).

**Why this order:** `AGENT.md` establishes the rules for interpreting
everything that follows. Skills establish universal and topic-specific
principles before any project-specific content is read, so that
project-specific content is interpreted *through* the framework's lens,
not the reverse. `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` are read last
because they are the most specific and most likely to be relevant to the
immediate task, and should be freshest in context when work begins.

**Why a gate, not a per-prompt reload:** once these files are in context
for a session, re-reading them on every single message wastes effort
without behavioral benefit. The gate exists to guarantee they are read
*at least once, always, before the first line of output* — regardless of
which developer started the session or what they asked first. It does
not exist to be re-triggered by ordinary conversation; it re-triggers only
on a genuine context reset or compaction, when the agent can no longer
assume the prior reads are still in its working context.

**What "before any response" means in practice:** no code, no
recommendation, no architectural opinion, no file edit — nothing
substantive is produced until this gate has been satisfied for the
current session. This includes trivial first messages (\"hi\", \"what
does this do?\") — the gate runs first, then the question is answered.
There are no exceptions based on the phrasing or apparent simplicity of
the first message.

---

## 2. Language-Agnostic Output Behavior

The full rule lives in `skills/language-agnostic-behavior.md`; it is
referenced here because it is foundational enough to call out at the
bootstrap level. In short: a developer may prompt in English, Roman
Urdu, a mix of the two, formally, casually, or in shorthand — the agent
parses *intent* from whatever language or tone arrives, but the
*output* (code structure, naming, documentation, commit messages,
architectural patterns) is always produced following this framework's
fixed conventions, regardless of the input's language or register. The
input's language/tone never changes the output's structure.

---

## 3. How Agents, Commands, and Skills Interrelate

Three layers, each with a distinct job:

- **`skills/`** — the knowledge layer. Concept-level, stack-agnostic
  principles. Skills don't act; they inform whoever is acting.
- **`agents/`** — the role layer. Each file is a persona (`builder`,
  `reviewer`, `tester`, `architect`) defining *what that role is
  responsible for* and *which skills it must apply*. A persona doesn't
  replace the skills — it tells the agent which lens to apply them
  through.
- **`commands/`** — the trigger layer. A thin shortcut that activates a
  given persona. A command file maps a user-facing trigger (e.g. typing
  `/build`, or the natural-language equivalent "let's implement this")
  to "load and behave as `agents/builder.md`, which in turn applies
  `skills/core.md` plus whatever skills that persona's file specifies."

**Relationship, concretely:** a command activates a persona; a persona
specifies which skills govern its behavior and in what priority; skills
are the actual content the agent reasons from. None of the three layers
is optional, and none substitutes for another — a command with no
persona has nothing to activate, a persona with no skills has no
content to apply, and skills with no persona/command have no defined
trigger for when they apply versus when they're just background
knowledge.

**Default persona when no command is explicit:** if a session begins
with an ambiguous or general request that doesn't map cleanly to a
single command, default to `agents/builder.md` for implementation work
unless the request is clearly a review, a test-strategy question, or a
foundational/cross-cutting decision — in which case route to `reviewer`,
`tester`, or `architect` respectively per their trigger criteria in
Section 4 below.

---

## 4. Routing

### 4.1 — Skill routing (which skills/ files apply to a given task)

`core.md` and `language-agnostic-behavior.md` apply to every task,
unconditionally. Beyond those two, route by the nature of the work:

| Task involves... | Load |
|---|---|
| Module boundaries, structural/design-time decisions, anything foundational-tier | `architecture.md` |
| Designing how failures propagate, exception/Result patterns | `error-handling.md` |
| Designing or modifying an API contract, versioning, request/response shape | `api-design.md` |
| Auth, authz, secrets, handling untrusted input beyond the Section 6 baseline in `core.md` | `security.md` |
| Writing or evaluating tests, coverage, test strategy | `testing.md` |
| The review process itself, beyond the checklist in `core.md` | `code-review.md` |
| Adopting a stack convention, evaluating a new pattern/library at decision time | `technology-handling.md` |
| Adding, updating, removing, or auditing dependencies over time | `dependency-management.md` |
| A performance trade-off judgment call | `performance.md` |

Load only what's relevant to the task at hand — loading all ten skill
files for every session is unnecessary overhead; the table above exists
so routing is deliberate rather than guessed.

**Stack-profile routing (in addition to the table above).** The skill
files above are stack-agnostic principle. The concrete, stack-specific
conventions for the project's actual stack live in a **stack-profile
folder under `skills/stacks/<layer>/<detected-value>/`** (e.g.
`skills/stacks/backend/java-spring-boot/`,
`skills/stacks/frontend/react/`), each containing focused files
(`conventions.md`, `security.md`, `testing.md`, and `error-handling.md`
for backends). Once the stack is resolved per Section 4.2, load the
folder whose path matches the resolved layer + value — the same
identifiers `detect_stack()` emits — and, within it, the file(s) relevant
to the task (e.g. `security.md` when the work touches auth), in addition
to whichever generic skill files the task routes to. A polyglot project
loads more than one profile folder (one per layer — e.g. a React frontend
profile plus a Spring Boot backend profile). If no profile folder exists
yet for a resolved stack, proceed on generic principles and offer to
create it from `skills/stacks/_TEMPLATE/` (see `skills/stacks/README.md`
and `technology-handling.md` Section 6). The generic skill files always
own the principle; a profile only supplies the stack-specific expression
and may never relax a generic rule.

### 4.2 — Stack routing: auto-detection first, declared block as override

At session start the agent **auto-detects the stack from project files**
(`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`,
`pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `build.gradle`, `*.csproj`, etc.) before
reading the `stack:` declaration block in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`.

**Priority order:**

1. **Auto-detect from project files** — primary source. This runs first,
   at session start, regardless of what the declared block says.
2. **`stack:` declaration block in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`** — treated as
   a reference/override, not as the mandatory first source of truth. If it
   exists and agrees with auto-detection, proceed. If it adds specificity
   that files alone can't express (e.g. `backend: python-fastapi` vs.
   just `python`), incorporate that specificity.
3. **Declared block overrides detection** only when it contains explicit
   information that project files cannot: version pins, layout conventions,
   deliberate architectural choices. If the declared block says something
   that contradicts what the project files show, flag the discrepancy
   explicitly (see conflict rule below).

**After the stack is resolved, load its stack-profile folder.** Once the
resolved stack values are known, load the matching
`skills/stacks/<layer>/<value>/` profile folder (per Section 4.1's
stack-profile routing) so the agent applies that stack's concrete
conventions, not just generic principle. A missing profile folder for a
resolved stack is a fillable gap handled the same way as a missing
`stack:` block below — offer to create it from `skills/stacks/_TEMPLATE/`,
don't block on it.

**When auto-detection is ambiguous:** if two or more conflicting
stack signals are present simultaneously (e.g. both `pom.xml` and
`package.json` with no clear boundary between them, or `requirements.txt`
alongside `go.mod` at the same directory level), the agent **must ask**
rather than guess. Never silently pick one signal over another in an
ambiguous case. State what was found and ask the user to clarify which
applies (or whether both apply in a polyglot setup).

**If detection succeeds and no `stack:` block exists in
`PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`:** proceed using the detected stack. Note the gap
proactively and offer to fill in the `stack:` block in the same turn —
this is a foundational gap, but a fixable one, not a blocker (see
Section 4 gap-handling below).

**If detection succeeds but conflicts with the declared block:** flag the
discrepancy explicitly to the user and ask for resolution rather than
silently trusting either source. State both what was detected and what
was declared, so the user can correct whichever is stale.

**A `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` with no `stack:` block** is treated as a
foundational gap; proactively offer to fill it using the detected stack
(see Section 4 below). Do not block work waiting for it — offer to fix
it in the same turn and proceed with the detected stack unless the user
asks to stop.

**Proactive gap-fix at session start:** if the agent detects a foundational
gap (no `stack:` block, missing `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md`, unfilled placeholders
in `DECISIONS.md`) at the end of the session-start gate read, it must
**proactively offer to fix the gap in the same turn** — not merely flag it
and wait. The offer should be specific: state exactly what is missing, what
the agent would fill in based on detection, and ask for a yes/no confirmation
before writing. Do not block the user's actual question while doing this —
answer the question and append the offer at the end of the same response.

### 4.3 — Tiering: foundational vs. feature-level

Some decisions are load-bearing and cross-cutting — auth strategy, data
model conventions, module boundary rules, naming conventions at the
project level, error-response shape across layers, anything that other
future decisions will depend on. These are **foundational-tier** and
require explicit sign-off before being acted on: route through
`agents/architect.md` via the `decide` command, and log the outcome in
`DECISIONS.md` tagged `foundational`.

Everything else — implementing a feature within existing guardrails,
fixing a bug, adding a test, refactoring within an established pattern —
is **feature-level** and can be done autonomously by any contributor
(human or agent) without requiring sign-off, though it still must follow
every applicable skill file.

**When in doubt about which tier a decision belongs to:** ask. Treating
an ambiguous decision as feature-level by default, just to move faster,
is exactly the failure mode this tiering system exists to prevent. The
cost of an unnecessary escalation is small; the cost of a foundational
decision made silently and inconsistently across a codebase is not.

### 4.4 — Single-root-knowledge-files, with a documented split trigger

`PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` are single files at the
project root, internally sectioned by stack (e.g. `## Frontend`,
`## Backend`, `## Shared/Cross-Cutting`) — not fragmented into
per-stack subfolders or files. This is a deliberate V1 decision:
foundational, cross-cutting concerns (how frontend and backend agree on
an error shape, how an auth token flows between layers) are inherently
cross-stack and would be poorly served by a structure that fragments
authority along stack lines.

**Documented escalation trigger — when to reconsider splitting:**
treat a single-file structure as outgrown, and raise a foundational-tier
decision via `decide` to formally split it, only when at least one of
the following becomes true, not preemptively:
- `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` or `DECISIONS.md` has grown large enough that
  finding a relevant entry routinely requires more than a quick scan or
  search (a concrete sign: contributors start asking "where's the entry
  for X" instead of finding it themselves).
- The project has split into genuinely separate teams with separate
  release cadences per stack, such that a single shared file creates
  merge contention as a routine occurrence rather than an occasional one.
- The project has become a monorepo housing what are, in practice,
  multiple independent products rather than one product with multiple
  layers.

A split, if and when it happens, must itself be logged in
`DECISIONS.md` as a foundational-tier decision before being carried out,
with the specific trigger condition cited as the rationale — never as a
silent structural drift.

## 5. Vendoring & Versioning

This framework is consumed by project repos via `sync.sh`, which copies
this repo's contents into a `.framework/` folder inside the consumer
repo and stamps a `VERSION` file (commit SHA + sync timestamp). See
`sync.sh` and the consumer-repo structure for details.

`.framework/` is committed to each consumer repo — it is never
gitignored or treated as a generated/ignorable artifact. A fresh clone
of any consumer repo must have this framework's guidance physically
present and readable without any extra setup step, which is the entire
reason vendoring was chosen over a submodule, package, or symlink
approach.

An agent operating in a consumer repo should check `.framework/VERSION`
if there is any reason to suspect the vendored copy may be stale (e.g.
the user mentions a recent framework update, or behavior described here
doesn't match what's actually present in `.framework/`) — but should not
treat a routine session as requiring a version check by default.

### 5.1 — Two command layers (both present, neither replaces the other)

This framework ships **two parallel command layers** that must both be
present and kept in sync after a `sync.sh` run:

**Layer 1 — `.framework/commands/`** (source of truth, agent-read)
The canonical command files vendored inside `.framework/`. Every agent
session that supports reading markdown files (Claude Code CLI, Cursor,
Copilot, Windsurf, or any other tool) reads these directly. These files
contain the full command logic. They must not be deleted, moved, or
modified by the consumer project.

**Layer 2 — `.claude/commands/`** (native slash commands, thin wrappers)
Populated by `sync.sh` at first sync. These are minimal wrapper files
that point back to their Layer 1 counterpart as the source of truth.
They exist so that tools with a native slash-command picker (Claude Code
VS Code extension, Claude Code terminal `/` menu) discover and expose
the framework's commands in their interactive menus without requiring the
user to know the `.framework/` path. The wrappers contain no logic of
their own — they load the corresponding `.framework/commands/*.md` file
and delegate entirely.

**Wrapper format used (`.claude/commands/<name>.md`):**

```markdown
---
description: org-framework /<name> — delegates to .framework/commands/<name>.md
---

Read and execute the instructions in `.framework/commands/<name>.md`,
then proceed as directed there.
$ARGUMENTS
```

Template versions of these wrappers live in
`templates/dot-claude-commands/` so a consumer repo can inspect or
regenerate them without re-running `sync.sh`.

**When `.claude/commands/` is absent (older consumer repos or tools that
don't support the directory):** the agent continues to use Layer 1
directly with no behavioral change. Layer 2 is an enhancement, not a
dependency.

---

## 6. Universal Scope

This framework applies to **every** developer interaction with an AI
agent on a project that has vendored it — every feature, every session,
by anyone: junior or senior, new to the project or long-tenured. It is
not an onboarding aid and must not be reintroduced as one. Onboarding a
new contributor faster is one *benefit* of this framework, not its
defining purpose or primary use case.

---

## 7. Anti-Hallucination / Traceability (standing meta-rule)

This rule governs how every other rule in this framework is applied,
not just how the framework itself was authored:

- No invented requirements. If something this framework doesn't cover
  comes up, say so and ask, rather than improvising a rule and
  presenting it as if it were already established.
- Any proposed addition to the framework itself — a new skill, a new
  persona, a new template field — must be flagged explicitly as
  proposed/optional until the user confirms it, never silently treated
  as already required.
- When something is genuinely ambiguous, or a real fork in approach
  exists, ask rather than assume — especially for anything
  foundational-tier that other decisions will be built on top of later.
- This applies with the same weight to the agent's own reasoning about
  *this framework's* files as it does to reasoning about project code:
  verification and explicit confirmation are the default operating
  mode here, not an exception reserved for unusually risky changes.
